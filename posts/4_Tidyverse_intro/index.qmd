# Introduction

There are many blogs or articles describing why using Tidyverse rather than the traditional R coding, for example

-   [Intro from Rstudio](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)
-   [rbloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/09/why-learn-the-tidyverse/)
-   [https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/](Tidyverse%20official%20site)

I am not going into details, but my main takeaways as a bioinformatician

-   Piping (%\>% ) is more natural if you come from bash scripting

-   Tidyverse is a universe with multiple packages, many of which are super useful, especially in data science.

-   The packages share common design, function arguments, data structures and so on

-   Many other packages are developed in this universe, making it a critical mass

# Logic of my blogs

I won’t cover topics that are easily searchable on Google or ChatGPT, such as how to install a package or run a function. Instead, I’ll focus on practical things you might encounter as a **bioinformatician**, with tips that I hope will help make your analyses more efficient.
