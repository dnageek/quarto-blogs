Today, I was thinking about how to organize my code snippets (in R or shell scripts) so I can quickly reuse them when needed. Of course, we have amazing AI tools like Claude Code, ChatGPT, and others that can generate code for specific tasks in seconds. Still, I often find myself wanting to reuse my own snippets—especially for tasks I repeat frequently. For example, when I want to generate a heatmap in the same style I’ve used before (a common need for bioinformaticians), having a reusable template is much more efficient.

Naturally, I started thinking about using Markdown, which allows me to display code alongside explanations and outputs. That’s when I came across [Quarto](https://quarto.org) —a powerful and flexible tool that seems perfect for this purpose.

**Comparison with R Markdown by ChatGPT:**

| Feature | Quarto | R Markdown |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Language support | Multi-language (R, Python, Julia, Observable) | Primarily R (some Python via reticulate) |
| Output formats | HTML, PDF, DOCX, slides, websites, books | Same, but Quarto handles more advanced formats more cleanly |
| Project management | Built-in support (multi-doc workflows, websites, books) | Requires more manual setup |
| Visual editor | Yes (RStudio) | Yes (RStudio) |
| Future support | Actively developed to replace R Markdown | Still supported, but focus is shifting to Quarto |
| Cross-language notebooks | Yes | Limited |

**Comparison with Jupyter by ChatGPT:**

| Feature | Quarto | Jupyter |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Document type | Markdown-based, reproducible docs | Code notebooks with rich outputs |
| Code+text workflow | Literate programming focus | More code-focused |
| Version control | Markdown = Git-friendly | `.ipynb` files are harder to diff |
| Formatting and layout | More control (with YAML, markdown, custom templates) | Less control unless using external tools |
| Multiple languages | Supports R, Python, Julia etc. in one document | Each notebook is language-specific |
| UI | Uses RStudio, VS Code, or CLI | Browser-based or via VS Code |

**Key advantages summarized by ChatGPT:**

| Feature | Quarto | R Markdown | Jupyter Notebook |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Multi-language support | ✅ | ⚠️ (via reticulate) | ❌ (1 kernel per notebook) |
| Web/slide outputs | ✅ Reveal.js, Websites | ✅ but clunkier | ❌ |
| Reproducible reports | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (can run out of order) |
| Version control | ✅ Markdown-based | ✅ | ⚠️ JSON, hard to diff |
| Parameterization | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

So let me give it a try!

-   Installation is easy, see details here: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
-   I took a quick look at the Guide: <https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>
-   Then I jumped in and created a blog: <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html>
-   Edited the template coming with Qoarto and here we go!
