# Use visual editor mode

I know you like writing Markdowns in terminals, but sometimes a visual editor is helpful, for example:

-   you can add an image very easily, simply like using word, you can screenshot and paste, the editor will generate a folder, place the picture in and write the link in your document in a second:

    ![](images/paste-3.png)

-   You can edit table easily, do you sometimes find yourself counting the "\|"s?

    -   

        | Col1 | Col2 | Col3 | Col4  | Col5 | Col6  | Col7 | Col8 | Col9 | Col10 |
        |------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
        |      |      | many |       |      |       |      |      |      |       |
        |      |      |      | empty |      | cells |      | you  | know |       |
        |      |      |      |       |      |       |      |      |      |       |
        |      | what |      |       | I    |       |      |      |      |       |
        |      |      |      |       |      |       |      |      |      | mean  |

-   Citations can be added too[@DeCarvalho2024], a references.bib will be added and managed by the editor

Actually very cool, and you can switch between text editor and visual editor very easily (Ctrl + Shift + F4), see more details on Quarto's documentation

# Publish to GitHub Pages

There is a good guidance at [Quarto]{https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html} on how to publish automatically to GitHub Pages. One error I ran into was: my Git functions worked well but "quarto publish gh-pages" didn't work. In that case, check if you have passphrase associated with your ssh key. This can be fixed following [this post](https://gist.github.com/danieldogeanu/16c61e9b80345c5837b9e5045a701c99)
