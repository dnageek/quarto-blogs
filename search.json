    "section": "",
    "text": "Data manipulation is a very important skill which helps to organize your data into a desired format, making it easier to analyze and visualize. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science, providing powerful tools for transforming and cleaning data efficiently. In this post, we will explore how to use Tidyverse functions to transform data for your analysis workflow.\nIn this post, we will continue to work on the mutation table we imported in our last post and convert it to a matrix. This process involves reshaping the data from a long format to a wide format, which is often required for downstream analyses such as clustering or heatmap visualization. We will use Tidyverse functions like pivot_wider() from the tidyr package to accomplish this transformation.\nThe pivot_wider() function is used to transform data from a long format (where each row is an observation) to a wide format (where each unique value in a column becomes its own column). This is particularly useful when you want to create a matrix-like structure for further analysis.\nThe pivot_longer() function does the opposite: it converts data from a wide format back to a long format, making it easier to tidy and manipulate data for plotting or modeling.\nBoth functions are part of the tidyr package in the Tidyverse and are essential tools for reshaping data in R.\n\n# Load all packages\nrequire(tidyverse)\nrequire(here)\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://plus.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/51065732\"\nfile_path &lt;- here(\"_data/OmicsSomaticMutations.csv\")\n\n# added this since we already downloaded it\nif (!file.exists(file_path)) {\n    download.file(url, file_path)\n}\n\ndepmap_mutation_data &lt;- read_csv(file_path, guess_max = Inf)\n\nFirst, let’s simplify the table using dplyr::select. This step isn’t really necessary if you’re already familiar with the data structure, but it makes it easier to see what’s happening in the data.\n\ndepmap_mutation_data &lt;- depmap_mutation_data %&gt;% \n                dplyr::select(ModelID, LikelyLoF, VariantInfo, HugoSymbol)\n\nDid you notice that I used dplyr::select() rather than select()? That’s to avoid namespace conflict, especially when you loaded too many libs in the same code.\nNext, we want to convert it to a mutation matrix:\n\nmutation.matrix &lt;- pivot_wider(depmap_mutation_data %&gt;% filter(LikelyLoF == TRUE) %&gt;% \n                        dplyr::select(HugoSymbol, ModelID) %&gt;% \n                        group_by(ModelID) %&gt;% \n                        count(HugoSymbol), \n                        names_from=\"ModelID\", values_from=\"n\") %&gt;%\n                        mutate(across(-HugoSymbol, ~replace_na(., 0))) %&gt;%\n                        mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ifelse(. &gt; 1, 1, .))) %&gt;%\n                        mutate(HugoSymbol = paste(\"mut\", HugoSymbol, sep=\".\")) \n\nLet’s break down the code step by step:\n\nFilters rows where LikelyLoF == TRUE (likely loss-of-function mutations). You can also use other filteres, depending on the data\nSelects only HugoSymbol and ModelID.\nGroups by ModelID (cell line) and counts the number of mutations per gene (HugoSymbol). The resulting data frame has one row per gene per cell line, with a count of mutations (n).\nUses pivot_wider() to reshape the data so each ModelID becomes a column, and each row is a gene, making the table wider\nReplaces NA values with 0 (no mutation).\nConverts counts greater than 1 to 1 (binary matrix: mutated or not). Usually we only care if a gene is mutated or not, but not how many mutation it has\nPrefixes gene names with “mut.” and replaces hyphens with underscores.\nRenames the HugoSymbol column to feature.\n\nThis process transforms the mutation data into a binary matrix suitable for downstream analyses like clustering or heatmaps.\nHere are some of the key functions used in this post:\n\nfilter(): Selects rows based on specific conditions.\nselect(): Chooses specific columns from a data frame.\ngroup_by(): Groups data by one or more variables for summary operations.\npivot_wider(): Reshapes data from long to wide format.\nmutate(): Adds or modifies columns in a data frame.\nacross(): Applies a function to multiple columns.\n\nThese functions are part of the Tidyverse and are essential for efficient data manipulation in R. We will continue to use them in future posts to tackle more complex data transformation tasks."

The entire column is filled with NA values, indicating that it was not properly loaded using the default read_csv() function. This highlights the importance of carefully reviewing your data after importing it. Always double-check for issues like this to ensure your analysis starts on the right foot.\nWhile read_csv() is generally a better option than read.table()—offering convenience by automatically handling quotes, separators, and headers—it is not foolproof. Even if your data is truly a CSV file, the importer may still encounter issues and fail to load your data correctly. This is a critical point to remember for any data scientist or bioinformatician: always validate your imported data to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n\ndepmap_mutation_data &lt;-

    "text": "Today, I was thinking about how to organize my code snippets (in R or shell scripts) so I can quickly reuse them when needed. Of course, we have amazing AI tools like Claude Code, ChatGPT, and others that can generate code for specific tasks in seconds. Still, I often find myself wanting to reuse my own snippets—especially for tasks I repeat frequently. For example, when I want to generate a heatmap in the same style I’ve used before (a common need for bioinformaticians), having a reusable template is much more efficient.\nNaturally, I started thinking about using Markdown, which allows me to display code alongside explanations and outputs. That’s when I came across Quarto —a powerful and flexible tool that seems perfect for this purpose.\nComparison with R Markdown by ChatGPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nQuarto\nR Markdown\n\n\n\n\nLanguage support\nMulti-language (R, Python, Julia, Observable)\nPrimarily R (some Python via reticulate)\n\n\nOutput formats\nHTML, PDF, DOCX, slides, websites, books\nSame, but Quarto handles more advanced formats more cleanly\n\n\nProject management\nBuilt-in support (multi-doc workflows, websites, books)\nRequires more manual setup\n\n\nVisual editor\nYes (RStudio)\nYes (RStudio)\n\n\nFuture support\nActively developed to replace R Markdown\nStill supported, but focus is shifting to Quarto\n\n\nCross-language notebooks\nYes\nLimited\n\n\n\nComparison with Jupyter by ChatGPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nQuarto\nJupyter\n\n\n\n\nDocument type\nMarkdown-based, reproducible docs\nCode notebooks with rich outputs\n\n\nCode+text workflow\nLiterate programming focus\nMore code-focused\n\n\nVersion control\nMarkdown = Git-friendly\n.ipynb files are harder to diff\n\n\nFormatting and layout\nMore control (with YAML, markdown, custom templates)\nLess control unless using external tools\n\n\nMultiple languages\nSupports R, Python, Julia etc. in one document\nEach notebook is language-specific\n\n\nUI\nUses RStudio, VS Code, or CLI\nBrowser-based or via VS Code\n\n\n\nKey advantages summarized by ChatGPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nQuarto\nR Markdown\nJupyter Notebook\n\n\n\n\nMulti-language support\n✅\n⚠️ (via reticulate)\n❌ (1 kernel per notebook)\n\n\nWeb/slide outputs\n✅ Reveal.js, Websites\n✅ but clunkier\n❌\n\n\nReproducible reports\n✅\n✅\n⚠️ (can run out of order)\n\n\nVersion control\n✅ Markdown-based\n✅\n⚠️ JSON, hard to diff\n\n\nParameterization\n✅ Built-in\n⚠️\n⚠️\n\n\n\nSo let me give it a try!\n\nInstallation is easy, see details here: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\nI took a quick look at the Guide: https://quarto.org/docs/guide/\nThen I jumped in and created a blog: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html\nEdited the template coming with Qoarto and here we go!"

    "text": "Use visual editor mode\nI know you like writing Markdowns in terminals, but sometimes a visual editor is helpful, for example:\n\nyou can add an image very easily, simply like using word, you can screenshot and paste, the editor will generate a folder, place the picture in and write the link in your document in a second:\n\nYou can edit table easily, do you sometimes find yourself counting the “|”s?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCol1\nCol2\nCol3\nCol4\nCol5\nCol6\nCol7\nCol8\nCol9\nCol10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nempty\n\ncells\n\nyou\nknow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhat\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\n\n\n\n\nCitations can be added too(De Carvalho and Vartanian 2024), a references.bib will be added and managed by the editor\n\nActually very cool, and you can switch between text editor and visual editor very easily (Ctrl + Shift + F4), see more details on Quarto’s documentation\n\n\nPublish to GitHub Pages\nThere is a good guidance at [Quarto]{https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html} on how to publish automatically to GitHub Pages. One error I ran into was: my Git functions worked well but “quarto publish gh-pages” didn’t work. In that case, check if you have passphrase associated with your ssh key. This can be fixed following this post\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDe Carvalho, Aline Martins, and Daniel Vartanian. 2024. “Quarto Website.” https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/XY4N7."
